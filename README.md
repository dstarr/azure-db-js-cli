# azure-db-js-cli

This small application illustrates several operations for working with the Cosmos DB SDK.  Uses `@azure/cosmos`, version 2 of the JavaScript Cosmos DB SDK.

```text
npm install
npm run
```

Open the app file and see the operation perform explicitly by commenting some `.then` steps out.
